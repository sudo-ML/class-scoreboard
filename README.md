This is a work in progress for a class scoreboard for use on teachers interactive whiteboards.
Right now it is just a .py file but it can be compilled into a .exe with Pyinstaller.

When the application is launched it will ask you if you want to import a list of students names
from a .txt file. If you choose to do so your .txt file must contain a simple list of students names
with one name per line and nothing else.

If you choose "no" you will be able to enter students names via a dialog box.

The scoreboard is always set to stay on top of any other window, this way it will display at the top of the screen
all the time while you are showing ppts or whatever to your class.
Select a student by clicking on them. You can press "Good" to add 5 points or "Bad" to subtract 5 points.

This is a work in progress and will likely have more features in the future such as sounds and saving scores.
